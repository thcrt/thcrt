    <h3>
        how it works
    </h3>

    <p>
        this site's code is written in Python, using the
        <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> web framework. almost everything is
        implemented on the server, and where javascript is used, it's not required in order to read
        the site's content normally.
    </p>

    <p>
        for ease of deployment, i use docker to run this site in production. images get built
        automatically for each new commit.
    </p>

    <p>
        everything gets run on a <a href="https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=fU9YkqLHWV6o">Hetzner Cloud</a>
        CAX21 VPS. full disclosure: that's an affiliate link, which will get you 20â‚¬ of credit. i
        don't expect anyone to actually use it, but hey, it's worth a shot, right? 
    </p>

    <p>
        the entire source code for this website is available in a
        <a href="https://github.com/thcrt/thcrt">GitHub repository</a>.
